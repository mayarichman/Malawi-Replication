            <p><strong>Migodi Yathu</strong> enables you to map, find, browse and search companies involved in exploring and extracting Malawi’s minerals. You can find the type of licences that have been issued, the companies that are involved and the minerals being sought. You can also filter the data to learn which projects and companies are operating near your home.</p>

            <p>This information is in the public domain but generally very hard to access and use in advocacy. Ongoing data collection requires scraping and searching the web, visits to different government offices to find records for companies, sorting through hardcopies of many, many documents, and more. The portal aims to help you dig deeper into Malawi’s minerals data that can be used in your advocacy for promoting responsible resource governance.  </p>

            <blockquote>“We want to make sure that Malawi does not just have a transparent governance of the sector, but actually reaches higher levels of accountability for the benefit of the people” <br />Hon Goodall E. Gondwe, Minister of Finance, Economic Planning and Development</blockquote>

            <p><strong>Migodi Yathu</strong> is a work in progress. In the coming months, you can expect to see company ownership, revenue and production information along with environmental and social commitments companies make. It is the first attempt by civil society to make this information more accessible and understandable.</p>

<p>This site is a project being implemented by Citizens for Justice on behalf of Publish What You Malawi and the Natural Resources Justice Network with support from Matchbox by The Engine Room.</p>
